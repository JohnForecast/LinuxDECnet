.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B dnetnml
is a daemon that serves incoming management requests from remote systems, usually
NCP in the case of VMS and RSX. It is recommended that the daemon be run from dnetd
by adding the following line to /etc/dnetd.conf:

.br
NML            19         N,N       nobody       dnetnml
.br

Currently it only serves a subset of information requests. These include all
forms of requests (SUMMARY, STATUS and CHARACTERISTICS) for NODES, CIRCUITS and
AREAS.
