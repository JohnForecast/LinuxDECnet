.TH DAPFS 8 "June 27 2024" "DECnet utilities"

.SH NAME
mount.dapfs \- Mount DAP filesystem over DECnet
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mount.dapfs <node> <mount-point> [-o options]
[options]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This tool is part of the DECnet programs (dnprogs) suite.
.br
mount.dapfs mounts a DAP filesystem on (probably) a VMS server
as a directory on a Linux system. It is invoked by the mount command
when usig the \-t dapfs switch. dapfs use the FUSE (Filesystem in USEr space)
system.

The node name specified must exist in /etc/decnet.conf or be a node address. 
With no options given dapfs will connect using a default DECnet account on
the remote server.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.TP
.I username=<name>
tells dapfs to use this username for the connection.
.TP
.I password=<pwd>
tells dapfs to use this password for the connection.
.TP
.I block
tells dapfs to return data using block mode rather than record mode. This will
return the whole of the internal file structure (eg with sequential files you
could get odd line endings where the record separators live). It is most useful
for reading binary data.
.TP
.B record
tells dapfs to read data using record mode (the default). 

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.TP
# mount \-tdapfs zarqon /mnt/vax
Mounts the default DECnet account on node ZARQON onto the Linux filesystem /mnt/vax
.TP
# mount \-tdapfs alpha1 /mnt/alpha \-ousername=SYSTEM,password=field
Mounts the home directory for the user SYSTEM on node ALPHA1, using the password "field" on /mnt/alpha.

.SH CAVEATS
All files are access by record and this can cause some odd effects if you are not expecting them. The
file size shown by VMS includes the record overhead of RMS, but dapfs shows only the record contents. 
utilities that get the file size (using stat) then read that many bytes into a buffer will end up with 
a file padded with zeros. There's not much I can do about this. Later versions of dapfs might include
an option to disable record access, but I think this is less useful as it would have to be filesystem-wide.

Seeking doesn't work unless you have a remote server that supports STREAM access to files 
(currently VMS 7.x seems not to). This means that some utilities (eg unzip) will not work as
they try to seek inside the file looking for data.
