.PP
.B fal
is a daemon that serves incoming DAP (Data Access protocol) connections from
remote systems. It provides sequential transfer and directory listing from
remote machines using standard DECnet syntax.
It may be started at system boot time (after DECnet has been started) running as root
or started on demand by dnetd. Note that this version of
.B fal
does not support decnet.proxy.
.br

The file names output by
.B fal
will always be Unix-style and all files sent by
.B fal
will be sent in STREAMLF format.

The options below affect the behaviour of fal. If you are using
