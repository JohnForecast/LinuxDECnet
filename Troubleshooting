1. Problem - Failed to load decnet3 module

    Error message in /var/log/messages:

	DECnet: DECnet address mismatch with xxx device

	where xxx is the ethernet/wireless device that DECnet is trying to use.

    The system was unable to change the MAC address of the xxx device. Examine
    the utility that you are using. If you make use of the systemd scripts
    generated by BuildAndInstall.sh, you may want to edit
    /etc/systemd/network/00-mac.link and replace the line:

	OriginalName=xxx

    with:

	MACAddress=<mac address>

    where <mac address> can be displayed by the command:

	/sbin/ethtool -P xxx
